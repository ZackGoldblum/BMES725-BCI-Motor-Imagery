# BMES 725 BCI Motor Imagery
This is the code for the BMES 725 term project "Real-time Classification of Motor Imagery Data via an EEG-based Brain Computer Interface" by Zack Goldblum, Dan Thompson, and Adam Wojnar. 

In this project we evaluate the validity of three convolutional neural networks ([EEGNet](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1741-2552/aace8c), [Shallow ConvNet](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/hbm.23730), and [Deep ConvNet](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/hbm.23730)) for the real-time classification of motor imagery tasks. Adapated verions of these models are from the [Army Research Laboratory (ARL) EEGModels project](https://github.com/vlawhern/arl-eegmodels).
